      <h1>Analyzing Global Terrorism Trends</h1>
      <p>
        According to Merriam-Webster, terrorism is the "unlawful use or threat of violence especially against the state or the public as a politically motivated means of attack or coercion."
        However, there is no universally agreed definition making it difficult to explain and quantify.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is without a doubt that this is not a 21st century phenomenon as its roots came from early religious groups trying to overcome one another. Modern day terrorism came
        largely into play after World War II with the culmination of political/religous groups worldwide to influence and transform people into their own beliefs.
        It was an effective way of paving local conflicts into international issues.

            The english word 'terrorism' actually came from the "regime de la terreur" which prevailed during the French Revolution. 
            During this period, the french government took terror into their own hands by enacting policy, creating new military domain, and sentencing thousands to death.

<!-- Policy makers to reduce terrorism, education, economics, military spending, which is the most expensive,
what is the way to solve terrorism. Attack lvl, which groups are the most active and identity factors that 
help us with the response of the groups.

All we are doing is to explain the terrorist behavior and find the models to predict
War on terrorism has been going on since 2001
Trillions of dollars of debt but not all of it is going into counter-terroristm
